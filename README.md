## Abstract:  

Full-Stack MERN Photo-Mapping application combining Create React App frontend with Nodejs-Express REST API backend and MongoDB Atlas cloud database.  The Photo-Mapping application integrates external Geocoding, Maps and Places APIs from Google Cloud Platform.  Users are required to upload a profile image during account registration. Once authenticated, users can create, update and delete their photo blog entries.  User authentication, a blog post image and a valid address is required when a blog entry is created.  The backend REST API retrieves blog post location data from Google Cloud Platform. The REACT App frontend then renders a map to the location. The REST API backend and REACT App front end are deployed separately as stand-alone apps on Heroku.  The code to develop this App was primarily taken from lectures created by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller then updated and combined with code inspired by lectures created by Brad Traversy.

**Install instructions**

**1.**  Clone the repoistory
```
git clone https://github.com/mheerspink75/MERN-Project.git
```
**2.** Install the backend and frontend npm packages
```
npm install && cd client && npm install
```

**3.** Login to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), create a new database and name it "places". Set up database access and network access and copy the connection string.

**4.** Login to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) dashboard, create a new project, enable the Geocoding, Maps Javascript and Places APIs and create and create an API key.

**5.** Create environment variables for the backend in the root directory by creating a nodemon.json file.
```
cd .. && touch nodemon.json
```
**6.**  Add your MongoDB Atlas connection string, Google API and JWT keys to the nodemon.json file.
```bash
# Add this script to nodemon.json
{
    "env": {
        "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "<YoUrApIkEy>",
        "ATLAS_URI": "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0-wqcxx.gcp.mongodb.net/places?retryWrites=true&w=majority",
        "JWT_KEY": "<jWtKeY>"
    }
}
```
**7.** Create environment variables for the frontend by creating a .env file.
```
cd client && touch .env
```
**8.** Add your google api key and dev server to the .env file.
```bash
# Add this script to client/.env
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=<YoUrApIkEy>
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_ASSET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
**9.** Run the dev server...
```bash
# Run the front end and backend dev servers concurrently
npm run dev
```
**10.** Or, run the frontend and backend servers individually...
```bash
# Run just the backend dev server
npm run server

# Run just the frontend dev server
cd client && npm run client

# Run just the frontend build folder
cd client && npm run build && npm run static
```
